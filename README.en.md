# dsh-suite

[中文](README.md)

Install 18 independent DSH plugins with a shared bundle of their defaults.

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@stardustlc/dsh-suite)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardustlc/dsh-suite) [![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@stardustlc/dsh-suite)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardustlc/dsh-suite)

## What it does

- Cover email, calendars, memory, media, developer tools and notifications.
- Pin component versions for reproducible installation and co-load checks.
- Components can also be installed and configured independently.

## Install

In DSH Desktop, install `@stardustlc/dsh-suite` from the Plugins panel. If the bundled dsh command is available:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile desktop add @stardustlc/dsh-suite
```

For the web version, replace `desktop` with `web`. Restart DSH after installation.

## Start using it

Install the suite when you need the full set, then configure the accounts and tools you use. For a few features, install the corresponding individual plugins. The guide lists the components.

## Requirements and configuration

Enable only the suite bundle in the profile; it loads the components. Each component still has its own account, executable and network requirements.

Detailed configuration, tool arguments and troubleshooting are in the [usage guide](docs/USAGE.en.md). For standalone development, follow the Node requirement in [package.json](package.json).
